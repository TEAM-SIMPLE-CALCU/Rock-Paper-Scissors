# RockPaperScissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a classic hand game usually played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of 
three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a fist), "paper" (an open hand), and "scissors" 
(a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V).
